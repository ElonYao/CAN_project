# CAN_project
This project aims to use the TI F280039C LaunchPad as the platform, exploring the integration of different peripherals. Then output target signals through CAN interface. 

@16th May, angle measurement and speed estimation have been implemented with an AS5600 encoder. 

@18th May, the CAN communication part is completed, test result is ok

@21th May, the freeRTOS version is completed, test result is ok. Make new branch(mainf_reeRTOS) for this version
